# parallels-desktop_vagrant_box (Resource)

Parallels Virtual Machine State Resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "parallels-desktop_remote_vm" "example_vagrant_file" {
  host  = "https://example.com:8080"
  name  = "example"
  owner = "ec2-user"
  # you can use your own local vagrant file 
  vagrant_file_path = "/path/to/Vagrantfile"
  #or use the box name/version to download the box from the vagrant cloud
  box_name    = "example/fedora-aarch64"
  box_version = "0.0.1"

  # These two fields will allow you to pass custom configuration to the vagrant file
  custom_parallels_config = "some config"
  custom_vagrant_config   = "some config"

  # This will tell how should we authenticate with the host API
  # you can either use it or leave it empty, if left empty then
  # we will use the default root user and password
  authenticator {
    api_key = "host api key"
  }

  # This will contain some common configuration for the VM
  # like if we should start it headless or not
  config {
    start_headless     = false
    enable_rosetta     = false
    pause_idle         = false
    auto_start_on_host = false
  }

  # This will contain a configuration for the specs of the VM
  specs {
    cpu_count   = "2"
    memory_size = "2048"
  }

  # this will allow you to fine grain the configuration of the VM
  # you can pass any command that is compatible with the prlctl command
  # directly to the VM
  # Attention: the prlctl will not keep the state, meaning it will always
  # execute the action and if you remove it it will not bring the machine
  # to the previous state before setting that configuration
  prlctl {
    operation = "set"
    flags = [
      "some-flag"
    ]

    options = [
      {
        flag  = "description"
        value = "some description"
      }
    ]
  }

  force_changes = true

  # This will contain the configuration for the shared folders
  shared_folder {
    name = "user_download_folder"
    path = "/Users/example/Downloads"
  }

  # This will contain the configuration for the post processor script
  # allowing you to run any command on the VM after it has been deployed
  # you can have multiple lines and they will be executed in order
  post_processor_script {
    // Retry the script 4 times with 10 seconds between each attempt
    retry {
      attempts              = 4
      wait_between_attempts = "10s"
    }

    inline = [
      "ls -la"
    ]
  }

  # This is a special block that will allow you to undo any changes your scripts have done
  # if you are destroying a VM, like unregistering from a service where the VM was registered
  on_destroy_script {
    // Retry the script 4 times with 10 seconds between each attempt
    retry {
      attempts              = 4
      wait_between_attempts = "10s"
    }

    inline = [
      "rm -rf /tmp/*"
    ]
  }

}
